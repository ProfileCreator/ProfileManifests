# ProfileManifests fork for iMazing Profile Editor

This repository is a fork of [ProfileManifests](https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileManifests/), optimized for use with [iMazing Profile Editor](https://imazing.com/profile-editor). The app, of course, fully supports using the upstream repository, but it points to this one by default as it allows for quicker updates and also for stylistic or app-specific adjustments.

The fork is continuously synced with upstream updates, and work done here is submitted back to the upstream when relevant to the whole Mac Admins community.

## Contributing
Please no issues or PRs here, unless they are iMazing Profile Editor specific. Instead, open these on the upstream, and if approved they will appear here quickly.

For easy manifest editing using iMazing Profile Editor, consult our [Working with Custom Manifests](https://imazing.com/guides/imazing-profile-editor-working-with-custom-preference-manifests) guide.

## Manifest Format
While the manifests on the upstream repository follow a strict [definition](https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileManifests/wiki/Manifest-Format) of syntax, you may encounter custom and yet-undocumented syntax on this one. In fact, the only guarantee for the manifests in this repository is that they are compatible with iMazing Profile Editor.
